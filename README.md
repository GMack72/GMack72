GMack72 - 
20 years experience as a functional consultant in SAP - specifically Enterprise Asset Management and Procurement in Logistics and Utilities sectors. 
For at least half of this time I have been teaching myself the SAP ABAP/4 coding language so I am very familiar with coding principles in general. 
Learning Python as a new language in order to transition into finding roles in AI/Machine Learning.
